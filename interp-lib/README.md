# interp-lib for sparse autoencoders

## State of stuff
- sparse_models
    + Somewhat done, but in need of a cleanup
- rasp
    + pretty broken
- ts_preprocessing
    + not even started
    + the vision is to.. have really nice ts preprocessing all in one.. package?
- hparam_search
    + Not even started


Maybe this should be named a different thing or be refactored somehow. It's named something fairly similar to interp_utils-- what's up with that?

Some things that might be important from interp_utils
- hook utils
- rendering stuff
- s3 stuff
- seriation utils
- general utils..?
